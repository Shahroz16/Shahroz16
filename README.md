### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in software development.

What do I do?

- 📱 Primarily, I develop large-scale Mobile applications and SDKs. This is my main area of expertise and where I spend most of my professional energy.

When I step away from mobile development, I like to dabble in other areas, not as an expert, but with curiosity and enthusiasm:

- 👨‍💻 I enjoy writing scalable backend applications. In this journey, I've had the opportunity to use **Python/Django** and **Golang**. It's an exciting process to learn and grow with these technologies.
- 🌐 Experimenting with Golang for developing **microservices**, especially those communicating over **GRPC**, is another area where I've expanded my skills. It's a fascinating exploration of how different components interact.
- 📈 I delve into the world of data, combining my interest in **data pipelines** and ETL processes with the creation of insightful visualizations and dashboards. Utilizing tools like Apache Airflow, Spark, Pandas, Tableau, and Redash, I find the journey from raw data to meaningful insights particularly rewarding.

Current Areas of Exploration and Focus:
- 🤖 Enthusiastically exploring the world of generative AI and its applications with the focus of engaging with and contributing to the evolving landscape of AI, and being a part of the ongoing AI revolution.
